# Development version

- Faster fits, set with the new `alscl_speed()`. Standard errors are computed in parallel within one fit (the fixed-effect Hessian by column and the delta method by ADREPORT quantity); the result is identical to `TMB::sdreport()`. Models are compiled with TMB's TMBad automatic-differentiation library, which evaluates the Laplace approximation and its gradient several times faster; estimates and standard errors equal those of the CppAD library up to floating-point rounding, and `alscl_speed(framework = "CppAD")` reproduces earlier results bit for bit. In the benchmark in `docs/SPEED.md`, fits were 1.25-1.68 times faster and results differed by at most 2.3e-11 (relative).
- Separate total optimization starts (`nstarts`) from socket workers (`ncores`), preserving `nstarts = ncores` by default. Record per-start PIDs, elapsed and CPU time, and optimizer diagnostics. / 分开控制总起点数与并行进程数，并返回逐起点执行证据。
- Add reproducible equal-work ACL/ALSCL benchmarks and parallel regression tests. / 新增相同工作量的并行实测与回归测试。

# ALSCL 2.0.0

- ACL 与 ALSCL 两种调查体长模型，支持年度及季度时间步。 / Two survey catch-at-length models with annual or quarterly steps.
- 内置 YTF 教学数据、完整模拟器、Excel 示例及实测数据导入说明。 / Built-in YTF teaching data, simulation, worksheets and observation import.
- 拟合诊断、模型比较、回溯分析，以及可调节的 ggsci 配色。山脊图默认使用 viridis 年份渐变。 / Diagnostics, comparisons, retrospectives and customizable ggsci colors; ridges use sequential viridis by default.
- 简体中文与英文对照的主页及 15 章 Wiki，包含全部公开函数和可复现 R 示例。 / Bilingual README and 15-chapter Wiki with all public functions and reproducible R examples.

安装 / Installation: `remotes::install_github("Linbojun99/ALSCL")`.
