> Age- and length-structured catch-at-length models for fisheries stock assessment

**ALSCL** is an R package for fitting population models to fishery-independent survey length data using [Template Model Builder (TMB)](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp). It provides an age-structured model (**ACL**) and a joint age–length model (**ALSCL**), together with simulation, diagnostics, model comparison and plotting tools.

Start with a [worked example](articles/first-model.html), browse the [basic functions](#contents) and [worked case studies](articles/index.html), or look up a function in the [reference](reference/index.html). The model framework is based on [Zhang & Cadigan (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12673).

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

Install the current version (2.2.1) from GitHub:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("FanZhang-LAB-SHOU/ALSCL")
library(ALSCL)
```

Fitting compiles the bundled TMB models, so an R-compatible C++ toolchain is required. See [installation and compilation](articles/getting-started.html) for platform-specific guidance.

<h2 id="models">Two model structures</h2>

| | ACL | ALSCL |
|---|---|---|
| Population state | Numbers by age and time | Numbers by length, age and time |
| Growth representation | Age–length probability matrix | Growth transition matrix |
| Fishing mortality | Estimated by age | Estimated by length; age-specific F is derived |
| Fitting function | `run_acl()` | `run_alscl()` |

Both models use three aligned input tables: survey numbers-at-length, mean individual weight-at-length, and maturity-at-length. Natural mortality and survey catchability settings are supplied. Their assumptions affect the scale and interpretation of the estimates; see the [model framework](articles/model-theory.html).

<h2 id="basic-use">Basic use</h2>

The bundled `YTF_example` contains synthetic yellowtail-flounder-style data, biological settings and known simulation truth. It is a teaching dataset, not the empirical dataset from the paper.

```r
data("YTF_example")
x <- YTF_example
inputs <- x[c("data.CatL", "data.wgt", "data.mat")]

# Fit both models to the same observations and biological settings
a <- run_acl(x, train_times = 2, silent = TRUE)
b <- run_alscl(x, train_times = 2, silent = TRUE)

plot_compare_ts(a, b, quantities = c("B", "SSB", "Rec"), se = TRUE)
```

ALSCL 2.2.1 accepts `run_acl(x)` and `run_alscl(x)` directly. For `YTF_example`, each function selects its model-specific `fit_config` automatically; explicit call arguments override stored settings. The original separate-argument and `do.call()` forms remain valid. Both use the same built-in acceleration; inspect `a$sd_info` or `b$sd_info` for actual execution.

The example fixes selected biological and process parameters. Its uncertainty intervals are conditional on those settings. The [worked example](articles/first-model.html) explains the inputs, fitted objects and data provenance.

<h2 id="check-fit">Check and interpret the fit</h2>

```r
diagnose_model(x$data.CatL, b)
plot_residuals(b, type = "year")
comparison <- compare_models(a, b, x$data.CatL)
comparison$summary
```

Check the optimizer status, maximum absolute gradient, Hessian and parameter boundaries separately. Then inspect residual patterns and sensitivity to fixed assumptions. A successful optimizer message alone does not establish reliable inference. See [diagnostics](articles/diagnostics.html) and [model comparison](articles/model-comparison.html).

This study applies ACL and ALSCL to Antarctic krill to examine how length-dependent growth and mortality within cohorts affect assessment results.

When reporting analyses, also record the ALSCL version, code revision, data source and fitted assumptions.
