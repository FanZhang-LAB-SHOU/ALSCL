#' Fit the ALSCL survey catch-at-length model
#' @param data.CatL Data frame or matrix with length labels in its first column,
#'   followed by at least two numerically labelled time columns.
#' @param data.wgt Weight-at-length, with identical labels, columns and dimensions.
#' @param data.mat Maturity-at-length between 0 and 1, with the same layout.
#' @param rec.age Recruitment age in years, greater than t0.
#' @param nage Number of age classes including the plus group (at least two).
#' @param M Nonnegative natural mortality per model time step.
#' @param sel_L50,sel_L95 Lengths at 50 and 95 percent survey catchability.
#' @param parameters Named list of initial fixed-effect values.
#' @param parameters.L,parameters.U Named lower and upper bounds. Bounds are aligned
#'   with free parameters after applying map. Initial free values are clamped to bounds.
#' @param map Named TMB factor mappings. factor(NA) fixes a parameter at its supplied
#'   value; NULL releases a default fixed parameter. Other defaults remain in force.
#' @param len_mid Finite length-bin midpoints; overrides automatic parsing.
#' @param len_border Interior boundaries, one fewer than the number of length bins.
#' @param output Save diagnostic tables and plots below output/ when TRUE.
#' @param train_times Positive integer; exact number of optimization passes per start.
#' @param ncores Positive integer; maximum number of socket workers for fitting
#'   independent starts. Uses at most nstarts workers; not threads within one start.
#' @param nstarts Positive integer; number of independent starts. Defaults to
#'   ncores for backward compatibility. Set explicitly to compare worker counts
#'   at equal work. Start 1 uses supplied values; later starts deterministically
#'   jitter free parameters only, identically for sequential and parallel fits.
#' @param silent Suppress fitting progress messages when TRUE.
#' @param growth_step Time between consecutive ages, in years. Use 0.25 for quarters.
#'   ACL infers rec.age when below one, otherwise one, if this argument is NULL.
#' @param zero_action Exclude zero observations as missing (historical behavior),
#'   or reject them with "error". NA is always missing; negative/infinite values fail.
#' @param control A named list of nlminb control settings.
#' @details M and F are per model time step; vbk is per year. The first and last
#'   length bins absorb the distribution tails. Compilation uses a writable session
#'   cache. Optimizer success, gradient size, Hessian status and boundary hits should
#'   be assessed separately before interpreting estimates or uncertainty.
#' @return A list with report, opt, obj, est_std, vcov, pdHess, gradient,
#'   max_abs_gradient (also final_outer_mgc), convergence_code, bound_hit,
#'   year, age, length-bin metadata, growth_step, elapsed and multi-start diagnostics.
#'   start_diagnostics records each start's PID, Unix start/end times, elapsed
#'   and CPU seconds, objective and convergence code; workers and nstarts record
#'   the actual worker count and total starts. The lowest finite objective is
#'   selected; inspect convergence diagnostics separately.
#'   sd_info records how the standard errors were computed: method (forked
#'   processes, socket workers for the delta method, or sequential), cores, elapsed
#'   seconds and a note; see \code{\link{alscl_speed}}.
#'   The DLL remains loaded so the returned obj can be evaluated in the same session.
#' @export
#' @param len_lower,len_upper Optional bounds consistent with len_border and len_mid.
#'   Infinite outer boundaries are allowed; the model treats the outer bins as tails.
#' @details ALSCL tracks joint length-age abundance and F at length; FA summarizes
#'   effective cohort survival. log_t0 represents a positive t0 below rec.age.
